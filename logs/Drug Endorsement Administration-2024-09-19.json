    "text": "If your friend is looking for a method of cannabis consumption that offers a timeline similar to smoking or vaping, they might consider using cannabis tinctures or sublingual sprays. These methods involve placing the cannabis extract under the tongue, where it is absorbed directly into the bloodstream. This can result in effects that begin within 15 to 45 minutes, which is closer to the onset time of smoking or vaping compared to edibles, which can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours to take effect.\n\nAnother option could be using cannabis-infused beverages, which may also have a relatively quick onset time compared to traditional edibles. However, it's important to note that individual experiences can vary based on factors like metabolism and tolerance.\n\nThese alternatives provide a smoke-free experience while still offering a relatively fast onset of effects.\n\nDisclaimer ðŸ“œ | Contact ðŸ“± | Github",

    "text": "Yes, you can make a tincture without using high-proof alcohol by using alternative solvents such as glycerin or vinegar. Here's a brief overview of how you can use these alternatives:\n\n1. Glycerin Tincture (Glycerite):\n   - Ingredients: Food-grade vegetable glycerin and your chosen herb or plant material.\n   - Method: \n     1. Chop or grind the plant material to increase surface area.\n     2. Fill a jar about halfway with the plant material.\n     3. Pour glycerin over the plant material until it's completely covered, leaving some space at the top of the jar.\n     4. Seal the jar tightly and shake it well.\n     5. Store in a cool, dark place for about 4-6 weeks, shaking occasionally.\n     6. After the steeping period, strain the mixture through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth into a clean container.\n\n2. Vinegar Tincture:\n   - Ingredients: Apple cider vinegar (or white vinegar) and your chosen herb or plant material.\n   - Method:\n     1. Prepare the plant material by chopping or grinding it.\n     2. Place the plant material in a jar and cover it with vinegar, leaving some space at the top.\n     3. Seal the jar with a non-metallic lid to prevent corrosion from the vinegar.\n     4. Store in a cool, dark place for about 4-6 weeks, shaking occasionally.\n     5. Strain through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth into a clean container.\n\nBoth glycerin and vinegar tinctures are effective alternatives to alcohol-based tinctures, though they may have different extraction efficiencies and shelf lives compared to alcohol-based ones. Glycerin tinctures tend to be sweeter and more palatable, while vinegar tinctures have a tangy flavor profile.\n\nDisclaimer ðŸ“œ | Contact ðŸ“± | Github",
