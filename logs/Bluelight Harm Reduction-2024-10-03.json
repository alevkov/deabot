    "text": "Drugs can be ingested through various routes of administration, each affecting the onset, intensity, and duration of effects. Here are some common methods:\n\n1. Oral: Swallowing pills, capsules, or liquids. This is a prevalent method for many substances, including pharmaceuticals and recreational drugs like MDMA and opiates.\n\n2. Sublingual: Placing the substance under the tongue for absorption, commonly used for drugs like LSD.\n\n3. Nasal (Insufflation): Snorting powdered substances through the nose, often used for cocaine and certain amphetamines.\n\n4. Inhalation (Smoking/Vaping): Smoking or vaporizing substances like cannabis or methamphetamine for rapid absorption through the lungs.\n\n5. Intravenous (IV): Injecting directly into the bloodstream for immediate effects, used with substances like heroin.\n\n6. Intramuscular (IM): Injecting into a muscle, offering a slower release than IV administration.\n\n7. Rectal: Administering substances via the rectum, sometimes used for higher bioavailability.\n\n8. Transdermal: Absorbing drugs through the skin using patches, common with nicotine or certain medications.\n\n9. Buccal: Absorbing drugs through the cheek lining, similar to sublingual administration.\n\n10. Oral Consumption with Food/Drink: Consuming drugs mixed with food or beverages, such as cannabis edibles or magic mushroom tea.\n\n11. Parachuting: Wrapping a powdered drug in a small piece of paper and swallowing it to delay onset slightly compared to direct swallowing.\n\n12. Plugging: Another term for rectal administration, often used in harm reduction contexts for certain substances.\n\nThese methods vary in terms of bioavailability and user preference based on desired effects and convenience.\n\nDisclaimer ðŸ“œ | Contact ðŸ“± | Github",
