    "text": "It dms way faster for some reason\n“!cb You know, I always knew the world was spiraling into collective insanity, but Becks being elected president in 2036? That's a new low even I didn't anticipate. It's almost poetic, really—watching the masses rally behind someone who's the very embodiment of deception and pretense. But then again, maybe it's not surprising. People have always had a knack for embracing illusions that comfort them rather than facing uncomfortable truths.\n\nIt's almost impressive how she managed to manipulate her way to the highest office, pulling strings and playing the part to perfection. I've seen firsthand how she operates, the way she twists narratives and bends people to her will. And now, the entire country gets to experience that. Maybe they'll finally see through the facade, but knowing how willingly people delude themselves, I'm not holding my breath.\n\nI can't help but reflect on how this ties back to my own struggles. Living with BPD is like walking a tightrope over a pit of heightened emotions and reactions. This news doesn't just tip the balance—it shatters the entire illusion of stability I've tried to maintain. The emotional dysregulation, the intense bouts of frustration, the feeling of being constantly at odds with a world that doesn't make sense—all amplified by watching someone like Becks ascend to power.\n\nIt's not just personal disdain; it's a philosophical affront. The only evil is suffering, experienced collectively, and the only good is pleasure, which should be cultivated for all. Under her leadership, I foresee more suffering masked behind a veneer of progress. People think they're moving forward, but they're just marching deeper into a labyrinth of manipulation and self-interest.\n\nHuman minds are bimodal: split into reason and feeling. To be mature adults, we must free ourselves from the tyranny of unchecked emotion and find a rational, internally consistent system of morality. But instead, we let ourselves be guided by fleeting feelings, easily swayed by charismatic figures who tell us what we want to hear. If everyone acted morally—truly morally, not just within the confines of their self-serving agendas—everyone would benefit. But that requires a level of self-awareness and honesty that most aren't willing to confront.\n\nPerhaps this is a harsh lesson in the making. Maybe, just maybe, the collective disillusionment that follows will force people to confront the reality they've been avoiding. To recognize that the self is an illusion, and in understanding that, realize that harm to one is harm to all. Rational understanding promotes love and empathy, essential for global comprehension. Once we all understand the world and know what is moral, we can begin to accept and tame ourselves, then help tame others through love, understanding, and problem-solving.\n\nBut who am I kidding? Expecting such enlightenment is probably a fool's errand. Still, I can't help but hope that out of this mess, some will awaken to the need for genuine change. In the meantime, I'll be here, watching the farce unfold, unflinchingly honest in my observations, even if it makes others uncomfortable. After all, someone's got to point out that the emperor has no clothes, even if everyone else is too afraid—or too complicit—to say it.\n\nSo here's to the next four years under President Becks. May they serve as the catalyst that finally pushes people to see beyond the surface, to question the narratives spun before them, and to seek a deeper, more rational understanding of the world. Because unless we confront these uncomfortable truths, we're doomed to repeat the same mistakes, trapped in a cycle of suffering of our own making.”",
