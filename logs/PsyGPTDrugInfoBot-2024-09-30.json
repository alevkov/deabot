    "text": "The 3rd plateau of a DXM (dextromethorphan) experience is characterized by intense dissociative effects and significant alterations in perception. At this stage, users often encounter profound changes in their sensory experiences and a heightened sense of detachment from reality. Here are some key aspects of what it feels like:\n\n1. Dissociation: Users experience a strong sense of detachment from their body and surroundings, often feeling as though they are observing themselves from an outside perspective.\n\n2. Altered Perception: There is a significant alteration in sensory perception, including visual and auditory distortions. Time may feel distorted, and users might experience intense hallucinations.\n\n3. Intense Experiences: The 3rd plateau is marked by intense experiences that can be both transformative and overwhelming. It is often described as being almost like a different drug compared to the 1st and 2nd plateaus.\n\n4. Numbness: A numbing sensation is commonly reported, contributing to the feeling of detachment.\n\n5. Disorientation: Users often feel disoriented during this stage, with a loss of coordination and difficulty in maintaining balance.\n\n6. Floaty Feeling: Many users report a sensation of lightness or detachment, often described as a \"floaty feeling.\"\n\n7. Profound Exploration: This plateau represents a deeper level of consciousness exploration, drawing users who seek profound experiences.\n\nOverall, the 3rd plateau is recognized for its intense dissociative effects and unique alterations in perception, making it a significant stage within the DXM experience spectrum.\n\nDisclaimer ðŸ“œ | Contact ðŸ“± | Github",
