"content": "Info on the game:\n\nMovement shooter with movement code directly inspired by GoldSrc and the Quake engine, prioritizing \"moments of cool\" a-la Ultrakill, with a spellcrafting inspired by Noita, with around 60 spell component cards existing already, also supposed to focus on the \"making character look cool/pretty/interesting/weird\" crowd with highly customizable customization. Weird intentions to do some avant-garde shit by splitting F2P and P2P players into two factions that work \"with\" and \"against\" the \"corporation\" big bad. Represent disencranchisement of the F2P players directly through narratives. Have F2P players taken down a significantly buffed \"Raid boss\" P2P players in a specific matchmaking mechanic wherein P2P players can be contracted to join games of, and kill a specific list of F2P players while they are in a PVE mode. Sort of an invasion mechanic. If I were to describe the feel of the game's intended atmosphere it'd be \"Cyberpunk but in dark fantasy, specifically a mix of fairytale cuteness and gritty shittiness that specifically is underlined as eating away at the adorable and most vulnerable groups (Beastmen get enslaved IMMEDIATELY as soon as possible based on a justification of being \"closer to being an animal\" - yes this gives me a based reason to have lots of furry fox girls in maid outfits) - the way the magic works in the lore is literally by tearing away the magic that lets the fairytale type creature be magical, takes away their culture by harvesting what is needed for it to exist as well as studying and sterilizing their specific magicks for public consumption etc. All the gay ass lefty lazy parallels but I did kinda join cultural appropriation and oil-economy's ecological damage and covering even the cultural damage done to people IRL due to oil harvesting (mana harvesting in the game). Wow the SUBTEXT it is so subtle it makes my eyes water. Other notable features - I made a 3D animated menu in the prealpha for some reason, also there's a scaleable matchmaking that kinda adapts to playercount using a disposable server processes to just ramp up capacity. Shit's cool, every server crash during testing was a logdump and an IMMEDIATE already booted and launched server running to replace it. Uuuuh I also added goombastomping and there's a secret unusabe Skyrim-style potioncrafting mechanic. And also there's secretly a fucking Diablo style variable item size inventory system that isn't used. And 3D UI for everything KEKW I wasted so much time doing polish shit before I'm out of prealpha it's dumb. Oh also Mudeth, the guy that did the Antibirth soundtrack (if you know you know) looked at the concept when I emailed him and he's down to compose for us at a reasonable rate IF ONLY I COULD FUNDED, LOOK AT WHAT I DID THINK WHAT I COULD DO WITH A TEAM PLEASE.\n\nFrom the video description.",

Also potentiates meth because it's an MAOI.\n\nUltra low dose quetiapine/ULDQ (Pending review) - antagonism at dopamine and noradrenaline receptors should allow for stochastic enforced \"rest state\" for a portion fo the receptors. Similar to ULDN (ULDQ being the new thing for stims) - the same idea. Think of how rotary guns avoid overheating. You're cooling off your barrels by switching between them. \n\nViagra - helps with joint pain and the obvious. lol I attached a screenshot that made me laugh. I was doing my due diligence on making sure it's not officially disavowed. This should also reduce risk of strokes. \n\nMemantine - Potantiator, reduces excitotoxicity, helps memory recall, reduces execuitive dysfunction.\n\nDXM - Only useful as a potentiator when taking it prior to usage. Generally useful, but couple it with chinese wolfberry to remove DXM's negative effects on mood and neurogenesis. \n\nBromantane + NALT - Prevents dopamine depletion entirely. And you guessed it - it's a fuckin potentiator too. Works by increasing expression of two rate limitng enzymes involved in dopamine synthesis. \n\nMitragynine (And 7-HO-mtg) - Kratom removes the feeling of contusion/head injury. This an effect that meth induces that mimics the feeling of head injury. Kratom entirely dispells it as it is KOR-mediated. Also a potentiator.\n\nWARNING: Do not habitually use benzos alongside stimulants \"because they help take the edge off\" you're training your brain to be a fucking retard by burning bartard neurology into your skull. (Editors note; the intense language is because this is real and will hurt your brain if you do that. Don't.)\n\nFootnotes: TAAR1 and TAAR2 are implicated in schizotypy. Both are agonized by meth.  TAAR1 and TAAR2 are also implicated in immune system pathologies induced by meth use. More research needed.\n",
